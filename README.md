# 📧 Email Spam Detection using Machine Learning

## 🚀 Project Overview
Spam emails affect productivity and security. The goal of this project is to **automatically classify emails as spam or ham (not spam)** using machine learning algorithms such as **Naive Bayes** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**.

## 📝 Problem Statement
Can we accurately classify emails as spam or ham using machine learning?

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build and evaluate a spam email classifier
- Use text preprocessing and feature extraction (TF-IDF)
- Compare Naive Bayes and SVM models
  
## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** [SMS Spam Collection Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset)
- **Fields:**
  - `label`: 'spam' or 'ham'
  - `text`: Email/SMS content
  - 
## ⚙️ Requirements
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- nltk

## 🧹 Preprocessing Steps
1. Lowercase text
2. Remove punctuation
3. Remove stopwords
4. Tokenize text
5. TF-IDF vectorization
